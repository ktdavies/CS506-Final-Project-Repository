# Project Description 

   For our final project we are interested in examining flight data. With the support of data from the FAA and NOAA we will discuss how weather affects flight delays. We aim to approach this question from the perspective of climate change and how emissions may affect local weather inturn affecting delays and making air travel more difficult as the world adapts to the current climate crisis. We hope to project how delays may worsen with climate change progression and offer solutions on how the aerospace industry may adapt to maintain high travel demand. 

 We anticipate collecting data from the FAA, Kaggle, NOAA and the EPA and to model characteristics found within the data set’s such as weather patterns, airlines, ticket prices, emission type, rate of emissions and region to predict the likelihood of flight delays and the duration and type of the delays. We will test data from a time period where emissions were lower then they are now and from more recently to draw comparisons and predict progression. Our results will be presented graphically and modeled with an interactive map. 

 To visualize the data we will use a mix of different methods to make everything clear and interactive. Throughout the project, we’ll use histograms and frequency polygons to track and display data training progress. For the final product we will make a real-time, interactive map to view flights, with weather and environmental overlays to show how conditions might impact travel. Flight paths across the country will be mapped out to highlight movement patterns. On the side, a panel will display flight numbers along with a score or percentage, giving insights into the likelihood of cancellations or delays.

# Goals
A clear description of our goals within this project is as follows: 
   - Successfully predict flight delays based upon weather
   - Model how flight emissions may impact weather
   - Examine how past emission increases have affected weather patterns 
   - Draw conclusions on how increased emissions may continue to affect air travel 


# Data Needs and Collection Methods

   We plan to first collect data on flight delays from accredited resources such as the FAA. We anticipate that we will have to cross reference our flight data from the FAA with more specific weather data from NOAA. In addition to these resources, we will support our claim of increased flight delays with progression of climate change with data from the EPA. 

# Data Modeling 
   To address our claim that climate change will lead to an increased number of flight delays we will utilize factors of delay such as weather, region, and traffic. These variables will serve as  input and will produce a predictor variable of delay as output. Additionally, we plan to examine delay duration as well as effects of increased emissions on weather with regression and machine learning models. 

# Data Visualization 
To visualize the data we will use a mix of different methods to make everything clear and interactive. Throughout the project, we’ll use histograms and frequency polygons to track and display data training progress. For the final product we will make a real-time, interactive map to view flights, with weather and environmental overlays to show how conditions might impact travel. Flight paths across the country will be mapped out to highlight movement patterns. On the side, a panel will display flight numbers along with a score or percentage, giving insights into the likelihood of cancellations or delays.

# Test Plan 
   With a focus on our conclusion of predicting how progressive climate change may impact flight delays and air travel, we plan to train data from a time period with lower emission rates and the amount of delays seen during that period and compare it with more recent data.
